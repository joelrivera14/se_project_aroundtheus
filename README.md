# Project 3: Around The U.S.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is Practicums (now TripleTen) project four - nine. I started this project simply just building out the layout first, slowly adding more JavaScript functionality as I progressed through the courses sprints. As I progressed, there was the addition of forms and form validtation, RESTful API's, and there was a change in structure; going from functional programing to OOP.

Semantic HTML
CSS grid
CSS media queries
Responsive web design
JavaScript
Form validation
JavaScript classes
Webpack
REST API
=======
this project involves the use of grid aswell as trying to implement responsive design into the webpage! achieved through the use of % and max width. this project also incorporates the use of JavaScript to make the edit button actually functionable.
