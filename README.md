# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is Practicums (now TripleTen) project four - nine. I started this project simply just building out the layout first, slowly adding more JavaScript functionality as I progressed through the courses sprints. As I progressed, there was the addition of forms and form validtation, RESTful API's, and there was a change in structure; going from functional programing to OOP.

# Technologies:

    Semantic HTML
    CSS grid
    CSS media queries
    Responsive web design
    JavaScript
    Form validation
    JavaScript classes
    Webpack
    REST API
