# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is Practicums (now TripleTen) project four - nine. I started this project simply just building out the layout first, slowly adding more JavaScript functionality as I progressed through the courses sprints. As I progressed, there was the addition of forms and form validtation, RESTful API's, and there was a change in structure; going from functional programing to OOP.

Technologies used : <br>
Semantic HTML <br>
CSS grid<br>
CSS media queries<br>
Responsive web design<br>
JavaScript<br>
Form validation<br>
JavaScript classes<br>
Webpack<br>
REST API
