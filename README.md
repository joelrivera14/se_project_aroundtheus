# Project 3: Around The U.S.

# Overview:

This is Practicums (now TripleTen) project four - nine. It is meant to allow the user to upload images as well as see images uploaded by other users and it allows for the interactivity of images uploaded.

# Functionality:

I started this project simply just building out the layout first with grid and flexbox and making sure the web page was responsive. I slowly added more JavaScript functionality as I progressed through the courses sprints. As I progressed, there was the addition of forms and form validation, a like/dislike feature, an image deletion feature, the use of RESTful API's, and there was a change in structure; going from functional programing to OOP.

# Technologies:

    Semantic HTML
    CSS grid
    CSS media queries
    Responsive web design
